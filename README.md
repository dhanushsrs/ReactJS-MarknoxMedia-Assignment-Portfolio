### Setup and Installation
## Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/dhanushsrs/ReactJS-MarknoxMedia-Assignment-Portfolio
cd portfolio

## Install Dependencies:
If you are using any CSS framework like TailwindCSS or Bootstrap, you can install those dependencies. For example, with npm:
npm install
## Note: If you're using plain HTML/CSS/JS without a framework, this step can be skipped.

## Configure Web3Forms API:
  1. Go to Web3Forms.
  2. Create a free account and generate an API key.
  3. Add the API key to the form configuration in your contact form.

## Open the Website:
  1. You can now open the index.html file in a browser to see your portfolio in action.
  2. If you're using a local development server (e.g., Live Server in VSCode), you can start it and view the website in the browser.

### Customization
  1. Portfolio Projects: Add your projects in the HTML or dynamically fetch them from an API (if you prefer).
  2. Web3Forms Settings: Update the form fields to collect the necessary information from users.
  3. Theme & Styling: You can customize the CSS to match your personal branding or portfolio theme.

### Contact Form
The contact form on this website uses Web3Forms for form submission. It doesn't require a server or complex backend. Web3Forms sends the form submissions to the email you have configured in your account.

### Deployment
You can deploy this website to platforms like:
  1. GitHub Pages: If you're using GitHub, you can deploy your site for free with GitHub Pages.
  2. Netlify: A simple drag-and-drop deployment process.
